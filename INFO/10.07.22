If you ever read something about a keylogger(Called Keyjeek-Keylogger or 
something like that idk): It's nothing else but fake news. I really 
don't know why but the authors of those blog posts are not responding. 
That actually says it all. Again to clarify: "nomotikag33n@gmail.com" is my 
contact email address. This address is and was not used for 
blackhat activities or something like that. Just for new 
ideas for my or new projects. I really don't know why they 
write about such lies in their blog posts but i'll try to contact 
the authors over and over again. 

Thank you for your understanding.
